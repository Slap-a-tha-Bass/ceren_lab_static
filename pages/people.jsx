            understanding the pathophysiology of traumatic spinal cord injury
            (SCI) in the acute and chronic stages with the purpose of developing
            novel dietary and rehabilitation strategies to improve
            neuro-recovery, metabolism, and bowel function. Thus, her laboratory
            is currently developing and testing therapeutic diets and electrical
            stimulation programs to evaluate new ways to prevent neuronal death
            and promote recovery and function in the acute stages and improve
            body composition, gut microbiome composition, and skeletal muscle
            and metabolic health in the chronic stages of SCI. She has received

            I grew up in Cleveland, MS (home of the Fighting Okra, yes look it
            up). I attended Mississippi State University for my undergraduate
            degree in Biological Sciences and Mississippi College for my
            master&apos;s degree in Biomedical Sciences. I have worked for the
            University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) as a researcher for
            7 years studying adolescent pediatric scoliosis in the pediatric
            population before returning to Mississippi State University for my
            doctorate degree in molecular biology and biochemistry. I worked for
            the USDA-ARS as a post-doctoral f ellow for 3 years as a geneticist
            prior to joining Dr. Yarar-Fisher&apos;s team where I am the laboratory
            manager and a researcher. Dr. Yarar-Fisher&apos;s program investigating
            spinal cord injury compliments some techniques that I have learned
            along my academic and professional career but, most importantly, has
            encompassed many new and exciting disciplines and techniques
            including bioinformatics, tissue culture, RNAseq, metabolic
            profiling, immunohistochemistry, and other procedures to study
            individuals with SCI. As a researcher, I contribute to running
            experiments, data analysis and writing and editing of manuscripts.
            My laboratory manager duties include keeping the laboratory safe and
            legal, reconciliation of accounts, and mentorship and training of
            physicians and medical, physical therapy, undergraduate, and high
            school students in the laboratory. Some of my interests outside of
            the lab include playing sports, hanging out with family and friends,
            home improvement, traveling domestically to explore different cities
            along with their food and culture, tailgating, and relaxing.

            I am a 4th year post-doctoral scholar at Rehabilitation Medicine
            Laboratory. I am from China, and I earned my master&apos;s degree in
            Molecular Genetics from the University of Cincinnati and my PhD
            degree in Nutrition Sciences from Purdue University. During my PhD
            training, I was involved with clinical trials investigating several
            aspects of dietary components on metabolic health outcomes. I
            greatly appreciated the applicability of human clinical nutrition
            research. In the meanwhile, I became interested in exploring the
            underlying mechanisms for the development of cardio-metabolic
            diseases. I joined Dr. Yarar-Fisher&apos;s lab in 2017 to further expand
            my training in nutrition research and gain additional skillset in
            microbiome and metabolomics analyses. My current research projects
            include: 1) investigating the effects of a
            high-protein/low-carbohydrate diet on body composition, metabolic
            health, and gut microbiome in patients with long-standing spinal
            cord injury and 2) understanding the relationship between gut
            microbiome and glucose control in individuals with SCI supported by
            the NIDILRR Mary Switzer Research fellowship and Craig Nielsen
            Foundation postdoctoral fellowship. I love spending time with my

            I am a second-year Doctorate of Physical Therapy student at the
            University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) in Birmingham, AL. I
            received my bachelor&apos;s degree in Psychology with minors in
            Neuroscience and Chemistry from the University of Mississippi (Hotty
            Toddy!). I am from Gulfport, MS, and I love the water. During my
            undergraduate career, I conducted research in a behavioral
            neuroscience lab and wrote and defended a thesis on Feedback Related
            Neuronal Processing During Motor Learning. This research contributed
            to a professional interest in neurological physical therapy.
            Throughout my undergraduate career, I also held multiple leadership
            positions in large scale community service organizations. This
            experience allowed me to realize that regardless of the exact nature
            of my future profession, I would like to work to serve others.
            Within the healthcare realm, that passion has evolved to working
            with and for medically underserved or marginalized populations. I
            currently serving as Clinical Director and Patient/Volunteer
            Coordinator for Equal Access Birmingham, a free clinic that serves
            the underinsured population of Birmingham, AL.

            I earned my B.S. degree in Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation from
            Hacettepe University in 2013. After graduation I started working at
            the same university as a research assistant at the neurological
            rehabilitation unit. I earned my MSc degree in 2016 in the field of
            neurological rehabilitation. My research focus was studying the
            effect of spinal stabilization exercises on walking and balance in
            patients with Multiple Sclerosis. I have continued my studies at
            Hacettepe University and started my doctoral training in the field
            of neurological rehabilitation. I am currently studying at Dr. Ceren
            Yarar-Fisher&apos;s Lab and investigating the effect of neuromuscular
            electrical stimualtion on muscle metabolism in individuals with
            sub-acute spinal cord injury.

            As a medical student just completing their first year, I chose to
            pursue research over the 2017 summer to increase the breadth of my
            research experience to include working with patients in a clinical
            setting and pursuing answers to questions that may later impact
            patient care and recovery. I was born and raised in Birmingham,
            Alabama and graduated with a B.S. in Kinesiology from The University
            of Alabama at Birmingham. My college career began nontraditionally
            at the age of 27 after working as a personal fitness trainer. I felt
            led to pursue higher education as I realized my passions were with
            caring for and educating others in areas of health and well-being.
            Ultimately, I felt the call of medicine and began attending The
            University of Alabama School of Medicine in late 2016. My first
            research experience was during my undergraduate career under Dr.
            Gordon Fisher, where I performed immunohistochemistry to determine
            muscle fiber type ratios in participants before and after
            interventional exercise programs and performed cross-sectional
            analysis comparing vital measurements such as blood pressure,
            arterial elasticity, and insulin sensitivity. I became much more
            familiar with principles and pathways for which I was already
            passionate, while also being able to see how these phenotypic
            differences may affect health outcomes and risk in certain patient
            populations. My limited experiences have led me to believe that a
            career in physical medicine and rehabilitation would be
            exceptionally rewarding and I was fortunate enough to be selected to
            receive the Summer Research Fellowship Award from the Diabetes
            Research Center. This opportunity involves conducting research under
            the guidance of Dr. Yarar-Fisher, as it relates to patients with
            spinal cord injuries and the examination of novel nutritional
            modalities and their effects on protection and recovery from damage,
            as well as brown adipose tissue distribution, functionality, and
            activity. Personally observing how dramatically a patient&apos;s mobility
            can be altered by a single event and then being able to explore
            questions and seek answers that may lead to improvements in such
            patients&apos; quality of life is a reward without parallel.

            I am a medical student about to start my second year here at the
            University of Alabama School of Medicine (UASOM). Born and brought
            up in Birmingham, I headed to Nashville, Tennessee for a change in
            scenery to attend Vanderbilt University for my undergraduate
            studies, earning a degree in Molecular and Cellular Biology. After
            gaining some perspective on basic science research during my time in
            college, I was curious to expand my horizons in the realm of
            research and try clinical or translational research. As a medical
            student, I wanted to enter an area of research that greatly
            interests me as well as an area that I could possibly see myself
            pursuing as a career. Taking neuroscience courses as an
            undergraduate gave me immense enthusiasm for medicine involving the
            nervous system and played a significant role in my decision to join
            Dr. Yarar-Fisher&apos;s lab. Through the Department of Physical Medicine
            and Rehabilitation Functional Neurorehabilitation Research Program,
            I received the FNR Scholarship award to do research this summer. My
            research will be investigating the effectiveness of a ketogenic diet
            in facilitating neuro-recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI).
            We believe processes that typically occur after SCI, such as
            glutamate excitotoxity, inflammation, and induction of apoptotic
            pathways, will be inhibited by ketone bodies resulting from a
            ketogenic diet. Our hypothesis is that 8 weeks of a ketogenic diet,
            as compared to a standard diet, immediately following SCI
            significantly improves motor and sensory function as well as
            functional independence in patients with complete SCI.

            I am a graduate student in the Department of Nutrition Science
            rotating in Dr. Yarar-Fisher&apos;s lab. I grew up in Miami, Florida, and
            attended Appalachian State University in Boone, NC earning my B.S.
            in Nutrition and Foods, and Exercise Science as well as my M.S. in
            Dietetics. I am incredibly excited and appreciative for the
            opportunity to work in Dr. Yarar-Fisher&apos;s lab. Rehabilitation
            Medicine is an area of research that has always interested me, but I
            have previously not had the opportunity to be exposed to. As a
            lifelong competitive athlete, I am interested in examining the
            differences both small and large between injured and trained muscle.
            Along with differences in how injured vs. trained muscle responds to
            nutrition. Gaining a better understanding of these intricate
            differences could lead to novel and improved nutrition and exercise
            intervention strategies for those with injury. Outside of school, my
            interests include running, hiking, cycling, cooking, traveling and
            hanging out with my French Bulldog, Django.
